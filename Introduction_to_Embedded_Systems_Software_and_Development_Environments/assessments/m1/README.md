# Array Data Analysis and Sorting

## Author: Luke Kaufman

### Project Description:
This project involves writing functions to analyze an array of unsigned char data items and report statistical analysis on the dataset. The following operations are required:

1. **Maximum**: Find the highest value in the dataset.
2. **Minimum**: Find the lowest value in the dataset.
3. **Mean**: Calculate the average of the dataset, rounded down to the nearest integer.
4. **Median**: Find the middle value in the dataset, rounded down to the nearest integer if necessary.

### Additional Requirements:
- **Sorting**: Reorder the dataset from largest to smallest.
- **Display**: Print the dataset and statistics in a well-formatted manner.
